Teleworkr

Just install the Teleworkr Agent on the user's
desktops via a central push or the user's can
self install.

No need to modify the corporate network.

Teleworkr

No ports opened in the corporate firewall, no risk. As no one can
access the desktops. This is the advantage of using reflection.

Teleworkr supports Multi-factor for logins. So people logging in
from home are strongly authenticated.

No need to make any changes to the corporate network,
just install Teleworkr agent on in-house desktops or servers.

Teleworkr's admin console allows the company to centrally
manage which users have access and who does not.

100% compatible with Windows OS. Not some proprietary protocol.
RDP is sent over fully encrypted tunnel using reflection. So again

doesn't allow anyone on the internet to access anything other than
authorized users.

No need for additional licensing as each Windows license includes
2 RDP licenses for free.
