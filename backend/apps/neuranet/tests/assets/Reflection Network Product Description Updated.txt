Introduction

This report is intended for architects, cybersecurity analysts and partners wanting to obtain a complete
understanding of TekMonks Reflection Network, regardless of the question type (i.e. financial, customer
or technical). It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of the Reflection
Network and has knowledge of fundamental network protocols, such as TCP/IP, which underpin
the modern network and the internet.

The data contained in this report was measured in a controlled environment and results obtained in other
environments may vary.

Components

Internal Server, Application, Device — This is the server/application or device which is sealed inside the
corporate network and is being reflected out to the Mirror Server via the Reflector component.

Reflector — This is the component which reflects the required internal server, application or device to the
Mirror Server.

Mirror Server — This is the end point architecture which is serving the users. A Portal is sometimes added
to this architecture based on requirements. For example, a Portal where users log into and pass Smart
Firewall authentication, gaining access to the Mirror.

Smart Firewall — This is a security component of the Mirror which only allows access to specific
authenticated users.

The components together make up what TekMonks call a Reflection Network which is suitable for:

* Securing applications and assets which must be exposed to the internet.

* Applications used by business partners. — Utilized for agents, agencies, resellers etc. Examples include
mobile B2B applications, like Agency Portals or Reseller Portals, that require secure access.

* Ensuring limited traffic. The reflection network ensures that all client traffic is limited through the
Mirror Server and no client can actually establish their own connection to the original servers.

* Replacing current VPN/Proxy configuration. The Mirror Server itself contains no data and access
privileges to the original server, meaning, even if a breach occurs, no data can be taken from the mirror
itself and a connection back to the original server can not be established. If a breach on a Proxy Server or
VPN gateway takes place, a connection back to the original server can be then formed.
Benefits Compared - Traditional VPN / Proxy Gateways

In this section, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of traditional corporate
network segmentation and protection tools in terms of Firewalls, VPNs and Proxy Gateways. A
comparison of this traditional network architecture to a Reflection Network will be made along with
showcasing the advantages provided by Reflection.

* Unlike VPN and Proxy Gateways, apps on the users” device do not have access to the companys’
network. This reduces risks related to personal apps, exploits, and malware on the users’ personal
devices and networks which are not managed by IT.

* Whether the user has malware, trojan horses, vulnerable apps or is targeted by hackers, the
company's network assets remain safe as there is no direct network tunnel between the user and
the company's network.

* Deploying the traditional model is similar to opening all of the company networks ports to any
application on the remote users device. This would require a full-blown network security audit
and hardening. When considering hardening includes dividing the network into subnetworks to
reinforcing passwords, closing unnecessary ports and other pertinent steps, it is easy to see that
the security preparations for deploying VPNs is a considerable project in and of itself. Utilizing
Reflection means these steps are not required as only the accessible apps & web apps are
published requiring zero open ports or network changes.

* There are fine grained role-based controls. For example, if using Reflection, a HR user may only
be provided access to HR web applications. With Traditional VPNs/Proxies everything is
available to remote users and there is no role-based access control. You can also think of this as a
secured office building. Traditional VPN/Proxies are like having the front door be the only
security access to the whole company, there is nothing stopping people from walking where they
please once authenticated. Reflection is like adding a door to each floor (floors representing each
individual system) with multi-level security systems in place so even though one can pass that
first entry door, they cannot go to any system in the network as they all have their own doors with
multiple security measures.

* Reflection technology saves significant bandwidth and can support much more users than VPNs
by ensuring the only bandwidth used is the corporate traffic between the user's laptop and the
corporate network. The rest of the personal traffic goes over the regular internet.

Furthermore, the critical difference between the architectures can be summarized in Figure 1.
Figure 1:

There is NO real data contained on this mirror server. Mirrors themselves
Hacker Gains Access have strong layers of security - We will discuss the Smart Firewall
Ignoring Authentication aspect shortly. However the important distinction here is that even if this

Step server is somehow breached, the hacker can not form a connection back
to the original server.

Smart Firewall Benefits
The Distinction:

There are additional benefits including access segregation with the Smart Firewall on the Mirror Servers.
Each internal application, desktop or server that is being reflected out to the Mirror, is then allocated to its
own distinct access port on said Mirror and is then closed by the Smart Firewall component. These ports
are subsequently only opened for authenticated users who have authorization to access those specific

apps.

For example, TekMonks reflects an Engineer related server to port A, and an HR related web application
to port B. When an Engineer then authenticates correctly, Smart Firewall will only open port A, related to
the Engineer’s role, removing the ability to attempt a lateral movement and blocking any attempt to
access the HR application.

Additional Benefits (include but may not be limited to):

* Smart Firewall preemptively bans attacks on IPs using the largest IP database (DB) from curated
blacklists.

* Integration with NIST — NVD (US Government, National Vulnerability Database) and Exploit-DB for
Anti-Malware, Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus protection.

* Malware-App detection for Mobile Apps — integration with Google App Store and Malware DBs.

* URL and Script Blocks to prevent external hosted script attacks, e.g. XSS, even if the Reflected
web App itself has vulnerabilities.

* Preventing various injection attacks via query parameter parsing at Layer 7 — SQL, XML, XSS
injections.
Ability to convert any application into an MFA compliant application.
Heuristic rules for Layer 7 outbound data protection against leaks.
Deep logging and audits via the SOC module, multi-level logs from User to Admin to Audit.
Client Journey - Deployment Options

When it comes to deploying a Reflection Network, the deployment process can differ depending on the
client requirements. There are granular choices on deployment location such as Mirror and Portal servers
being on prem, on cloud, inside/outside of the client DMZ. or even hosted in the TekMonks cloud.
However, in all cases, the Reflector component must be installed inside the internal network.

Related to the Reflector component itself, there are two distinct choices a customer can make for
deployment. For the following scenario, TekMonks is under the assumption that the Mirror and Portal
servers are deployed in the TekMonks cloud.

Reflector Deployment Options

1. Using installers for each office desktop.
2. Deploying a Reflector Virtual Machine (VM) / Hardware within the network.

Option #1: Installers

When clients choose this method, an installer executable file, provided by TekMonks, will need to be run
on all the clients office Desktops that they wish to connect to securely.

Below is a simple diagram (figure 6) of a Reflection Network architecture using installers. In this
instance, both PCs have used the installer to install a personal Reflector component that then connects to
the Mirror individually under a distinct port number. This method is used when only accessing desktops
remotely. Ie. not other internal applications.

When running the installer, each machine utilizing that installer is mapped to a mirror port which is then
mapped to an app for a certain user to access on their Portal. After the installation, a Reflector has been
successfully set up on the specific office desktop itself, and will then formulate a connection to the Mirror
Server.

If the IP of the office desktop changes, via DHCP or some other method (i.e. changing from wireless to
ethernet to ensure stability) the installer that's running will restart the service itself and the connection is
refreshed. The office desktop will then connect to the mirror again. Most importantly, the previous port
number it connected to on the Mirror originally also remains the same.


Local loopback IP address is used to generate RDP, if machine IP is changed, does not matter. This RDP
connection is forwarded to the Mirror on a certain port.

During the time the users run the installer, a popup also appears that allows the user to then create their
authentication account to use as login credentials on the Portal. If the user chooses "No" for creating an
account during the installer phase, they are given a service account number which, in turn, is a unique ID
meaning they can add it as an additional application to their currently existing authentication account on
the Portal instead. Successful installation of desktop installers maps the machine's rdp to a mirror port
even if the account is not created using them.
Option #2: Reflection VM

Instead of the Reflector component running on the machine itself and creating connections to the mirror
per machine, this approach deploys a Reflection VM (containing multiple Reflectors) in the same
perimeter of the network as the desired services/systems to be remotely accessed. The VM is a large-scale
Reflector that is responsible for forwarding all the desired connections to the mirror. Each internal
component that is reflected out is still mapped to an individual mirror port.

This architecture is required when the desired access is not only Office Computers.

In the above diagram (figure 8), note that one system is a Windows Desktop for RDP and the other is an
Internal App / Service. This architecture covers a variety of internal access requirements. For example, a
NAV server or a Legacy Application. In short, anything you wish to connect to securely, that is not an
Office desktop, will require this architecture.

To send these connections to the Mirror Server, access must first be gained via the use of this Reflection
VM which is why it needs to be installed within the same network segment as the applications desired to
be accessed are. The Reflection VM contains a list of ports that the Mirror can provide authenticated
access on, so these connections are then forwarded by the VM to the mirror. The IP addresses are stored
inside the Reflection VM as a reference. This means if the original system IP addresses are changed, the
Reflection VM needs to be updated.

Customers Journey

The customers journey for setting up this architecture is as follows:

1. Receive VM files and set up manually.

2. Install the VM in the desired location | Join a call with a representative from TekMonks and get
walked through the installation.

3. Notify TekMonks when completed.
TekMonks will then access the VM remotely and make all configurations.

As for installing the VM, the options of installation are:
1) VM OVA* or Hyper-V file provided by TekMonks.

2) A DEV Reflector provided by TekMonks which can run on an existing Windows computer.

*An OVA file is a virtual appliance used by virtualization applications such as VMware Workstation and Oracle VM Virtualbox. It is a package
that contains files used to describe a virtual machine, which includes an OVF descriptor file, optional manifest (MF), certificate files, and other
related files.

Additionally, TekMonks supports a plug and play model where the client is sent a physical hardware box
with the Reflector (Reflection VM) already installed. Once confirmation that both power and ethernet on
the box have been plugged in, TekMonks then administers this setup remotely - Skipping steps 1 - 3. The
end result after configuration, whether it be VM or Hardware, is depicted in figure 9 below.

Shared Architecture

1. Portal
2. Mirror

Now that the differences between each architecture have been discussed, the shared architecture between
the two options will be highlighted. This can be summarized in figure 10.

As stated earlier, customers also have a choice to use TekMonks hosted Mirror and Portal, or have their
own deployed Mirror and Portal. There are also some instances where clients have not requested a Portal
server and instead are authenticated via a program on their client system that then instructs the mirror to
open a connection for that particular user.


Summary

Setup using installers:

* DHCP and Static IP both supported.
* Support clipboard and file transfer restrictions.
* Only available for Windows Servers and Office Desktops.

Setup using Reflection VM:

Can be used to connect to other applications in the internal network, not just office computers.
Requires machines with static IP

Supports sending a wake on lan message to remotely turn on Windows PCs.

Does not support DHCP changes for the machine addresses.

What they have in common:

* For each device/application that is reflected, is mapped to a mirror port which is then mapped to an
app to be accessed via the Portal.
* Users can be assigned apps based on access control.

Case Two, Insurance Company. *
*We cannot disclose the name of this business due to NDA but will refer to it as “Insurance Company.”

Adoption Year: 2020
Adoption Duration As of 2022: 2 years

Challenge: Various applications set in the Insurance Company had critical functions with associated data
utilized by users for daily tasks.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) was used for remote connectivity and communications from outside the
office. Having limited security options, they were vulnerable to threats upon access of office resources.
Explicit support for custom solutions was also lacking for remote access, particularly for AS400-like
applications.

Solution: Terminated the need for VPN and implemented Reflection Network instead with built-in
smart-firewall in mirrors. Associated vulnerabilities were then bypassed for extra emphasis on security.
Reflection Network allows users to block any incoming connection to their internal office network that
makes them completely secured while serving the mirrored services. Hence, only those registered users
are allowed for remote access to office resources via a Portal that connects to mirrored connections.

Case(s) Two: Japanese Companies - Working from Home*
*Currently in the process of asking each company for consent to provide their name in our use cases.

Adoption Year: 2020
Adoption Duration As of 2022: 2 years

Challenge: Teleworking is increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, including work life balance. The
basic widespread availability of internet access and mobile computing devices makes it a viable option for
all types of organizations. To hit on a current issue everyone is facing globally, the COVID-19 pandemic
is causing a great number of individuals to work from home. Organizations are struggling to find a way to
allow easy, secure and reliable access to their organizations systems while still keeping their employees’
safety in mind.

Solution: TekMonks created an architecture where both Mirror and Portal are hosted on TekMonks cloud,
and various Japanese companies have set up a complete work from home solution effectively and
efficiently, as all they were required to do is run an installer provided. There are the various benefits the
architecture of Reflection Network that have been expressed throughout this document and, of course, the
security mentioned in the document applies here, but additional benefits and reasons for adoption, in
relation to adapting to the pandemic, are as follows:

1) No change to their corporate network.

2) Extremely fast and simple setup procedure.

3) Other work from home options had limitations, i.e. no MacOS support for home - or tablet, or
even smartphone - TekMonks supported all these devices to be used when working from home.

4) No cap on amount of office desktops a user can add to their account (some clients use multiple
different desktops, and even share computers among each other) - Other products in market have
certain limitations such as 1 device per user, or having to buy licenses in bulk - TekMonks
provided a ‘license as required” model.

Financial Benefits

The very nature of preventing a cyberattack is an immeasurable financial benefit to a corporation. As
stated in the previous user case section, TekMonks will be using Leading Global e-Commerce Business as
the primary example of the estimated financial benefits gained from their journey with TekMonks.
However, as Leading Global e-Commerce Business, and most companies do not disclose this information,
estimations with what known facts TekMonks have will be made. Following that, a more generic
overview of Reflection Networks financial benefits.

Regarding The Leading Global e-Commerce Benefits:

Our client corporations calculate their financial risk themselves and do not share with anyone. However,
TekMonks can generate a rough estimation as follows:

Stated in the previous section, before the Leading Global e-Commerce Business approached TekMonks,
they were facing at least 1 cyberattack each month. When using information on impactful hacking
statistics of 2020, “The average cost of a data breach is $3.860,000 USD”. This figure is excluding very
large data breaches, and very small ones, as to not skew the data.

This numerical value was deduced from various stages of response to an attack. When a breach occurs,
heavy costs are incurred due to the corporation requiring to pour resources into processes such as:

1) Investigation, audit, assessment services and general crisis management.

2) Notifying all key third parties and stakeholders with emails, letters, general notice and
engagement with outside experts.

3) Attempting to prevent or minimize the loss of business with various activities - this can be a side
effect from the attack, such as business disruption, due to systems being down. The cost of losing
customers and additionally having to regain new customers is also critical, among avoiding
reputation loss and bad faith.

4) Post response after the attack, having to spend fees on legalities and recuperating losses. Adding
in new support and new patches to systems - training help desk staff and so on.

With this outlook, TekMonks can make a rough estimation of financial benefits to the Leading Global
e-Commerce Business. In our five years with the client, they have never been subjected to an attack or
breach. As previously stated, they were facing at least 1 cyberattack each month, for 6 months prior to
contacting TekMonks.

"IBM, “Cost of a Data Breach Report,” 5.
17
This means before adopting the Reflection Network (even if TekMonks underestimate the cost of an
attack to $2,000,000 USD) they were facing up to $12,000,000 USD in damages in their prior 6 months of
joining. If TekMonks use this figure as a year cost basis, it is $24,000,000 USD. Seeing as this Leading
Global e-Commerce Business has been with us for 5 years, that would be a grand total of $120 million
USD of potential damages caused due to cyberattacks.

This was then reduced to zero when implementing Reflection.

Now, of course this number is not going to fit into every single company. As a company's losses, if they
are hacked, depends on various factors such as size, severity and response. For a large company, losses
can be hundreds of millions of dollars and for a small company it will be less. There are also a lot of costs
spent from the company’s own agency - i.e. if they decide to hire external help / pay legal fees etc., which
will also lead to different costs, as it is dependent on the resolution path they take.

Other Financial Benefits

Related to other financial benefits that Reflection Network brings - nonspecific to a response to an attack,
TekMonks can overview as follows:

* All security measures like AMP, CDN, WAF, Firewall, DDoS mitigation are built into the mirror
already at no extra cost. Reflection will save you money by removing the need to buy additional
security software.

* Hasily meet PCI compliance as client data is on a fully isolated server.

* Hasily meet security audit goals as confidential data is on a fully isolated server and all
communication is AES 256 encrypted with military grade encryption.

* GDPR and similar compliance - Store data on local servers inside the foreign country, yet be able
to act on the data for business use cases globally.

* Improved bandwidth performance (in cases, up to 50%) over VPN. This is crucial for companies
who serve a large volume of clients or perform critical business remotely, as faster speed means
less delay and an overall improvement in job performance.
