It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition. English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its content is written independently of other editions[1] in various varieties of English, aiming to stay consistent within articles. Its internal newspaper is The Signpost. English Wikipedia is the most-read version of Wikipedia,[2][3] accounting for 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining percentage split among the other languages.[4] The English Wikipedia has the most articles of any edition, at 6,821,927 as of May 2024.[5] It contains 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias,[5] although it lacks millions of articles found in other editions.[1] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021.[6] English Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for Wikipedia overall, has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias.[7][8] While its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s,[9][7][10][b] having become an important fact-checking site.[11][12] English Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than other language editions due to its broader editor base.[2] Articles Screenshot of Wikipedia's article on Earth, 18 January 2023 pening English Wikipedia's main page with Mozilla Firefox 99 on Ubuntu 20.04 Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include \"featured articles\",[13] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[14] navigation templates,[15] the sorting of short \"stub\" articles into sub-categories,[16] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[17] and weekly collaborations.[18] It surpassed six million articles on 23 January 2020.[19] In November 2022, the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes.[20] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four million.[6] Currently, there are 6,821,927 articles created with 916,845 files. The encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias (down from more than 50% in 2003).[21][22] The English Wikipedia currently has 47,377,967 registered accounts of which 859 are administrators.

The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by \"sharp\" comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014."],
