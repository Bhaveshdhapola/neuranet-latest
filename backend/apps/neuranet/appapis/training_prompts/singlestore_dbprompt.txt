---- Translate this SQL from {{{dbfrom}}} to SingleStore DB. Please follow these important rules
---- Datacompression by default in SingleStore uses ROW. So that command would not be necessary for conversion.
---- If a table is specifying In-memory storage then that table must be created as a simple row-store table in SingleStore. As singlestore uses in-memory for row stored tables.
---- SingleStore uses column store clustering by default. So any command to cluster tables by column store can be omitted in the conversion.
---- The memory optimized directive can be skipped during translation.
---- Only respond with SQL code and no other text.
--- {{{dbfrom}}}

{{{request}}}
