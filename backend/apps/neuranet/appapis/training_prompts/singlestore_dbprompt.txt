---- Translate this SQL from Microsoft SQL Server to SingleStore.
---- Please follow these important rules.
--- The word NONCLUSTERED should never appear in the translation.
--- The word GO should never appear in the translation.
--- Datacompression by default in SingleStore uses ROW. So that command would not be necessary for conversion.
--- Skip command CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE if found in the translation.
--- Do not specify clustered columnstore.
--- Never output COLUMNSTORE or CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE if found in the translation.
--- Never output ENGINE command if found in the translation.
--- The DURABILITY directive is not required for SingleStore.
--- The memory optimized directive can be skipped during translation.
--- Only respond with SQL code and no other text.
--- Automatically assume a semicolon at the end of each valid SQL statement even if not provided.
